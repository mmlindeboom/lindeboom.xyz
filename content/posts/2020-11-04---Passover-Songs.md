## Four Questions
To “Banana Pancakes” by Jack Johnson


D7        G7                    D7<br>
But baby, I see that you  might  notice<br>
Am7           C7<br>
tonights a little different<br>
     G7                D7<br>
This song is meant to ask why<br>
     Am7                  C7<br>
Four questions so we get to<br>

G7            D7<br>
Dip twice and we gotcha<br>
Am7            C7<br>
reclining on that sofa<br>
G7              D7<br>
but no banana pancakes<br>
   Am7               C7        Am7<br>
maror and only matzah now<br>
 <br>
[Chorus]<br>
                                      G7<br>
Why so different  than all other nights?<br>
                                Am7<br>
Can't you see that it's just framin’<br>
                                     G7<br>
There ain’t no freedom without the fight<br>


## Ten Plagues
To "Ring of Fire" by Johnny Cash

G              C          G<br>
Pharaoh, wouldn’t let us go,<br>
              D           G<br>
So Moses had to take control<br>
        C             G<br>
The nile turned red, full of blood<br>
        D                 G<br>
But Pharoah didn’t give a fudge<br>
<br>
D                C              G<br>
Oh Moses said to let our people go<br>
 D                               C             G<br>
But Pharaoh was an asshole and boy he didn’t know,<br>
G                 D           G<br>
 So god god god, she sent 10 plagues<br>
D                G<br>
she sent 10 plagues<br>
<br>

The sky rained frogs every where ya looked<br>
You couldn’t walk far, without a ribbit and a squoosh,<br>
Pharaoh flipped out, said the Jews can go<br>
When the frogs disappeared, he changed his mind like whoa,<br>
<br>
~Chorus~<br>
<br>

When Pharaoh broke his vow, Moses cried you fail,<br>
God said let there be beasts<br>
bugs, boils, pestilence and hail<br>
Even after all those plagues, it wasn’t enough<br>
now comes the part, about the fucked up stuff<br>
<br>
~Chorus~<br>
<br>
Locusts came, and darkness went<br>
But Pharaoh he, still wasn’t spent<br>
 haraoh thought, it was all a sham (fake news!)<br>
So he missed the signs of the paschal lamb<br>
<br>
~Chorus~<br>
<br>
